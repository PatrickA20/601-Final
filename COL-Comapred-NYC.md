First I want to look into the histogram and show that the density peaks between an index of 30-40 and quickly begins to flatten before getting to NYC's index at 100, resulting in a right skewed graph. The ranks of all the countries are based on this index so it is fair to assume this histogram and bar graph are the most likely to have clear patterns. And as we can see the bar graph comparing the ranks to the Cost of Living Index start at 100 with NYC at rank 0 and swiftly get lower to rank 121, however in this graph "Rank 1" actually has a slightly higher index than NYC with 101.1. I've created an interactive graph so it is easier to see the Cost of Living Index for each rank.
